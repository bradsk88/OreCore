OreCore

Welcome to OreCore!

OreCore (or OC) is a mod which strives to unify the common ores used by many 
other mods.  I'm developing this mod because, as a player of modded Minecraft, 
I didn't like having 8 different copper ores, ingots, and dust items cluttering
up my NEI console.

My goal is to coordinate with the bigger (and, ideally, smaller) mod builders 
to incorporate my mods with theirs.  As such, OreCore is going to be a mod that
ONLY provides ores, ingots and dust items.  

Of course, like most mod builders, I'm going to have the temptation to create
my own unique items which make use of the ores in OreCore.  In order to retain
the reusability of this mod, though, I will not be including those unique items.
Instead, I will be creating a peripheral modpack for extra items which can be 
used by anyone interested.

The extra items pack is called: ByProducts

This mod provides the following commonly needed ores:
Copper Ore:
-Melts into one copper ingot
-Crushes into two copper dust and up to three copper2 carbonate dust

Bauxite Ore:
-Melts into one aluminum ingot
-Crushes into one aluminum dust
-Chemically dissolves into two aluminum clusters (ByProducts Mod Only)
--Aluminum clusters directly melt into ingots (ByProducts)

I just spilled juice on my keyboard and I felt like documenting it here...

Tin Ore:
-Melts into one tin ingot
-Crushes into two tin dust

Iron-Manganese Ore:
-Mines for 1 iron dust and 1 manganese dust

Osmium Ore:
-Melts into one osmium ingots
-Crushes into two osmium dust

Magnesium Ore:
-Melts into three magnesium nuggets
-Easy to mine

Ilmenite Ore:
-Mines into two titanium nuggets
-Easy to mine

Rutile Ore:
-Mines into two titanium nuggets
-Easy to mine
