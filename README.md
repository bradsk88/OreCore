OreCore
=======

A minecraft mod which ONLY provides ores - hopefully to be used as a standard

Every item in this mod should be obtainable in some way in Vanilla Minecraft.  No machines should be necessary.

All metals are obtainable as dust by shoveling their gravel.  For example, iron dust is obtainable from iron gravel 
ore.  Mind that, unless configured otherwise (TBD) it may be quite difficult to come across these gravels.

Targeted Mods
=======

I intend to fork the following mods to replace their ores with mine and hopefully the mod creators will accept my 
pull requests.  If not, I will leave the forks open for those who wish to download these other mods using my ores.

If you would like to use OreCore in your mod, please feel absolutely free.  I would love to list it here and help maintain it, so please let me know if you decide to use it or any of my other mods.
