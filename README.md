OreCore
=======

A minecraft mod which ONLY provides ores - hopefully to be used as a standard

Every item in this mod should be obtainable in some way in Vanilla Minecraft.  No machines should be necessary.

All metals are obtainable as dust by shoveling their gravel.  For example, iron dust is obtainable from iron gravel 
ore.  Mind that, unless configured otherwise (TBD) it may be quite difficult to come across these gravels.

Targeted Mods
=======

I intend to fork the following mods to replace their ores with mine and hopefully the mod creators will accept my 
pull requests.  If not, I will leave the forks open for those who wish to download these other mods using my ores.

Mekanism  
Tinkers Construct  
Mariculture  
Railcraft  
Thermal Expansion
